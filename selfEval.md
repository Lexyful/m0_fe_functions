# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
    I have been realizing that breaks are a necessity. If I just sit and stare at the computer without a break, I spiral and i'm totally unable to find
    my way out. Then, I'm stuck on something way longer than I would have been had I stepped away and come back with a clear mind. Then I no longer have
    the anxiety that blocks my ability to do my work.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?
    I would tell them that a function is like a game. Every deck of cards has the same amount of jacks, queens, kings, and numbers. And every time you 
    buy a deck of cards it's the same thing. The winner only wins buy playing buy the same rules every time.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
    arguments are the data and parameters are the place holders
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
    When and how would you combine functions to other structers of code?
